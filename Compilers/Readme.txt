                        README for Code Generator
=========================================================================

Buck Harris, Connor Thorpen

Introduction:
-------------
All necessary files for building and running our code generator are included in this 
submission. This README provides basic information on how to compile and run everything, as 
well as details on where the output is located. 

Compiling and Running:
----------------------
To compile and run the program, enter the commands:

"make" to run on mg.f23
"make 1" to run it on te1.f23
"make 2" to run it on te2.f23
"make 3" to run it on te3.f23
"make 4" to run it on te4.f23
"make clean" will delete all files generated by our compiler

Output:
-------
The generated code will be written to yourmain.h. The parse tree, symbol table, and results of 
running f23.c will ge printed to stdout and save to a file called proofOfOutput.txt. Running the 
code on a different example will overwrite this output file.

Who Did What:
------------
For this assignment, Connor and Buck generaly worked together on the code, but more specifically
Buck did function headers and function/procedure structure, while Connor did arithmetic and 
parameter/agument handling. 

What Works:
----------
Our code producted output for tiny example 1,2,3,4 which seems to all be correct. So with that
our addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division should all work. We have function and
procedure calls with return statements working. We have prints statements working correctly.

What Almost Works:
-----------------
What almost works is using the correct variables in functions, we pass them correctly,
but don't utilize them in the functions correctly.

What Doesn't Work:
-----------------
For our generated code, what hasn't been implemented and therefore doesn't work is
loops, if statements, arrays, and general scope.
